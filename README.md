# Event-Management-System-MySQL-File
A SQL database project to manage events, clients, venues, services, staff, and bookings (comments added).

Includes:
> Structured tables with relationships (clients, venues, events, services, staff, bookings).
> Sample data for quick testing.
> Example queries for reports like top bookings, event details, and service usage.

How to use:
Import the .sql file into MySQL Workbench/MariaDB → run the script → start querying :)

Extra Note:
> I have uploaded; ERD Diagram(.png file), report(.pdf file), powerpoint presentation (.pptx file) in the same repository, just in case it may help out someone.
> This was my 4th semester "Database Theory" Course project, that's why there is an ERD Diagram, Report, and a PowerPoint Presentation attached.
